# json2Array-VB
Converting nested json data into 2D Array in VBA

The JSON2Array.bas file has a function JSON2Array which takes JSON string as input and returns 2 dimensional array.
This helps in accessing the resultant array easily with index positions instead of keys.
Its easier to move this array to excel worksheet.

1.  OS        : Windows (Not tested on Mac)
2.  MS-OFFICE : 2007 and later

Installation:
1. Import JSON2Array.bas into your project (Open VBA Editor, Alt + F11; File > Import File)
